We have chosen sentences about fictional countries ( featured in the Marx 
Brothers' 1933 movie Duck Soup ) to emphasize that your ability to reason 
about these examples does not depend on what is true or false in the 
actual world. If you know the meaning of the word no, and also know that 
the capital of a country is a city in that country, then you should be 
able to conclude that the two sentences in (6) are inconsistent, regardless 
of where Freedonia is or what the population of its capital is. That is, 
there's no possible situation in which both sentences could be true. 
Similarly, if you know that the relation expressed by to the north of is 
asymmetric, then you should be able to conclude that the two sentences in 
(7) are inconsistent.

Broadly speaking, logic-based approaches to natural language semantics 
focus on those aspects of natural language which guide our judgments of 
consistency and inconsistency. The syntax of a logical language is 
designed to make these features formally explicit. As a result, 
determining properties like consistency can often be reduced to symbolic 
manipulation, that is, to a task that can be carried out by a computer. 
In order to pursue this approach, we first want to develop a technique 
for representing a possible situation. We do this in terms of something 
that logicians call a model.

A model for a set W of sentences is a formal representation of a situation 
in which all the sentences in W are true. The usual way of representing 
models involves set theory. The domain D of discourse ( all the entities 
we currently care about ) is a set of individuals, while relations are 
treated as sets built up from D. Let's look at a concrete example. Our 
domain D will consist of three children, Stefan, Klaus and Evi, 
represented respectively as s, k and e. We write this as D = {s, k, e}. 
The expression boy denotes the set consisting of Stefan and Klaus, the 
expression girl denotes the set consisting of Evi, and the expression 
is running denotes the set consisting of Stefan and Evi. 1.2 is a 
graphical rendering of the model.
